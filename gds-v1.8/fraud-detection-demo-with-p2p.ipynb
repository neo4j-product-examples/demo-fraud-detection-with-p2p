It involves reversing a payment and triggering a dispute resolution process, often for billing errors and unauthorized credit use.

    "In this example, it is unclear to me what exactly is taking place, and I have a hunch that the fraud activity is not completely labeled given the lack of connectivity and the limited chargeback logic used to flag fraud. At the same time I do not want to simply label every user that shares a card or device with another flagged account, since it is possible that a benign user's device and or card was used fraudulently by another. Since fraudsters are actively avoiding being identified, actors committing fraud are often not just represented by a single user account, but rather by multiple accounts and identifiers which, hopefully for us, share some connections and similarities.\n",

In a real-world scenario these business rules would pass by SMEs and possibly be backed by further supervised machine learning on manually labeled data. More advanced techniques for this type of ER are possible in graph and we describe them in [this whitepaper](https://neo4j.com/whitepapers/graph-data-science-use-cases-entity-resolution/) and [this blog](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/exploring-supervised-entity-resolution-in-neo4j/).\n",

Hence I used somewhat stringent rules that aligned with the patterns noted in part 1. We can apply relationships to reflect these business rules using cypher:\n"

    "Users in the above result list are sorted by how much identifying information they share with previously labeled fraud risks, the ones with the most being at the top. Technically speaking, these users are ranked by their total Id fraud risk, which is equal to the sum of the fraudRiskRatios from the Identifiers they are connected to. In the query I also implement a limit on the average fraud risk to avoid users that just have a lot of high-degree identifiers (likely proxy ip addresses shared by only a small fraction of fraud risk users). This sort of filtering can be tweaked by use case to get the right balance between total risk vs average risk.\n",

    "### Using Node Similarity to Expand on Fraud Communities\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple calculations like weighted degree centrality work well for identifying suspicious users over the whole graph, but what if we are interested in how users are related to a specific fraud risk community or set of communities? Perhaps we hypothesize that communities of fraud risk users are actually bigger than currently represented but we don't have exact business rules to apply. We can leverage similarity algorithms to help us score and recommend users for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "GDS offers multiple algorithms for similarity. In this analysis I will focus on the aptly named  Node Similarity algorithm – you can read more about it [here](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/node-similarity/). Node similarity parallelizes well and is explainable. It identifies pairs of similar nodes based on a straightforward Jaccard similarity calculation. So while other ML-based similarity approaches like FastRP + KNN covered [in this post](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/exploring-practical-recommendation-systems-in-neo4j/) scale well for running globally on very large graphs, Node Similarity is a good choice where explainability is important and you can narrow down the universe of comparisons to a subset of your data. Examples of narrowing down include focusing on just single communities, newly added users, or users within a specific proximity to suspect accounts. In this analysis we will take the third approach, filtering to just those Cards, Devices, and IP addresses that connect to at least one fraud risk account from part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I apply three queries to calculate node similarity. The first query enables the identifier filtering via setting a new label on the Card, Device, and IP address nodes that connect to fraud risk accounts. The first query also weights relationships by the inverse of degree centrality, essentially downplaying the importance of identifiers proportional to the number of other users they connect to. This is important as some identifiers, particularly IP addresses, can connect to hundreds or thousands of users, in which case the identifier may be very generic (like a proxy IP address) and not as relevant to true user identity. The second and third query project the graph and write relationships back to the database with a score to represent similarity strength between user node pairs. You will notice that I use a similarity cutoff of 0.01 in the third query, which is intended to rule out weak associations and keep the similarities relevant.\n"

    "\n",
    "In real-world scenarios we often don't know which user accounts are fraudulent ahead of time. There will be cases, like with this dataset, where some accounts get flagged due to business rules, for example chargeback history, or via user reporting mechanisms. However, as we saw in parts 1 & 2 above, those flags don't tell the whole story. The community detection and recommendation approaches we previously covered can go a very long way in helping us understand this story and label additional fraud risk users and patterns. That said, there are multiple reasons why we may want to add supervised Machine Learning to predict the additional fraud risks:\n",
    "\n",
    " - __Proactive Detection:__ We can train a model to identify fraudulent actors ahead of time (such as before additional chargebacks or system flags) and better identify new communities that aren't connected to older known fraud accounts.\n",
    " - __Measurable Performance:__ Supervised learning models produce clear performance metrics that enable us to evaluate and adjust as needed\n",
    " - __Automation:__ supervised Machine Learning automates the prediction of fraud risk accounts.\n",

Going into the exact pros and cons of these models is out of scope here. Overall, I like exploring classification with Random Forests since they are relatively robust to feature scaling and collinearity issues and require minimal tuning to get working well."

    "Perhaps unsurprisingly, they exhibit the P2P with shared card behavior, they also have a relatively large number of credit cards (the median degree centrality on cards is 3). This could potentially be a sign of fraud, though it is hard to know on an anonymized dataset like this. This is where subject matter expert review and iteration comes in. If this behavior turns out to be a clear indicator of fraud, it means we are predicting fraud more proactively before chargebacks take place which is the ideal. In this case, if we re-label these users appropriately and re-train our ML model as more data comes in, we will further improve predictive performance. If, on the other hand, it turns out that some of this behavior is benign, we can adjust the feature engineer and model so the ML learns to rule out such cases which will likewise improve predictive performance and increase our understanding of fraud patterns. Either way, it is a win."
